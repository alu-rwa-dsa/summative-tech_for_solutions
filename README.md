To briefly describe our solution, It is a membership registration and tracking system that will help an organisation named Ndabaga Sisters Organization (NSO). Now, what is NSO, and what do they do? NSO is a Rwandan feminist to empower women and eradicate gender inequalities of all forms. The organisation assists its members with civil rights advocacy, economic opportunities, mental health, and many other basic needs for gender discrimination and abuse victims.  According to the organisationâ€™s hiring policy, members can post for a post after two years of membership. Due to this policy, it is essential for the organisation to have a reliable system to track the membership of every member, their entry dates, and their statuses. 
 
Our solution is to provide NSO with an efficient system to handle member registration, membership tracking, and membership cancellation.
